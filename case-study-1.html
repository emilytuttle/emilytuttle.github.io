            <h2>Role</h2>
            <p>UX designer and researcher leading the app design from conception to delivery. Responsibilities included user research, wireframing, prototyping, mockup creation, and presentation creation.</p>

                <h2>Project Goal</h2>
                <p class="dual">Tony's Restaurant was in need of a mobile app to provide regular customers with a more convenient mobile ordering experience. While websites are accessibile through phones, they don't probide the option to save ordering information. With a dedicated mobile app, users are able to save their order information to place repeat orders, but more importantly, save previous order billing information.</p>

            <div class="target-box box">
                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p class="dual">Ideal users include busy people who want a specific app for their favorite restaurant instead of using a website everytime. These users include people of various ages and backgrounds, and therefore must be accessibile to all.</p>

    <div class="challenges-box box">
        <h2>Key challenges or constraints</h2>
        <p>Tony's Restaurant is a fictional restaurant, so previous designs from existing branding or websites could not be built upon. Design sheets were made from scratch, as were customer profiles. However, this allowed for total creative freedom. There was no existing budget for this project, so all user testing particpants were volunteers.</p>

    <h1 class="heading">Research</h1>

    <div class="research-box box">
        <h2>Research Study Details</h2>
        <p>Research included competitive audits and persona creation to discover common user pain points.</p>
        <h4>Common Pain Points</h4>
        <ul>
            <li class="bulleted">- Not finding menus</li>
            <li class="bulleted">- Not having information saved</li>
            <li class="bulleted">- Difficult to edit orders</li>
            <li class="bulleted">- Long Processes</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Sketching & Wireframing</h2>
        <div class='wireframes'>
            <p class="word-by-pic">Wireframes were created with a very simple user flow in mind, with the menu option front and center. User pain points included difficult to find menus, long processes, or difficult order editing, so the goal was to make these as simple as possible. Items could be added to the order from the menu page, to avoid looking for items twice.</p>

                <h4>Round 1 User Testing Findings</h4>
                <p>-A more detailed confirmation screen would decrease confusion</p>
                <p>-Multiple types of edit buttons were confusing, so only one should be shown</p>
                <p>-Remove buttons were necessary to make the order confirmation screen  more usable.</p>

            <div class="box">
                <h4>Round 2 User Testing Findings</h4>
                <p>-Animations were not high quality yet</p>
                <p>-User flow was missing a profile edit option</p>
                <p>-Users didn't like the size of the edit buttons</p>

    <h1 class="heading">Conclusion</h1>

    <div class="conclusion-box box">
       
        <p>Tony's Restaurant now has a fictional mobile app to go with their fictional restaurant. In the future, the app can be engineered for mobile use, and have a web application built to go alongside it. The web application would not provide an option to save payment information, but it would remove the need to download an app for irregular or first-time customers.  </p>
